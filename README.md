#GIT AND GITHUB
If you’ve never used git and github before, there are a bunch of things that you need to do. It’s very well explained on github, but repeated here for completeness.

1. Get a github account.
2. Download and install git.
3. Set up git with your user name and email.
4. For the first time you setup and use git and github, create first a sample repository in github and name it Practice-Git-GitHub.
5. After creating your Practice-Git-GitHub repository, clone the repository into your Desktop. Simply copy the link from github and clone it on your desktop.
6. Then open the cloned repository with Visual Studio Code.
7. Then simple open the terminal in your Visual Studio Code, if it is your first time follow the configuration steps below:

Open a terminal/shell and type:

git config --global user.name "Your name here"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"

8. After doing the configuration, you can now practice, create a new file and name it index.html.
