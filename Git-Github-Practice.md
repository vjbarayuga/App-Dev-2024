# Git and Github: 
If you’ve never used git and github before, there are a bunch of things that you need to do. It’s very well explained on github, but repeated here for completeness.
1. Register for a github account.
2. Download and install git.
3. Set up git to github with your user name and email.
4. For the first time you setup and use git and github, create first a sample repository in github and name it Practice-Git-GitHub.
5. After creating your Practice-Git-GitHub repository, clone the repository into your Desktop. Simply copy the link from github and clone it on your desktop.
6. Then open the cloned repository with Visual Studio Code.
7. Then simply open the terminal in your Visual Studio Code through this shortcut, ctrl + back ticks, the symbol of the backticks (~) is beside the number 1 key in your keyboard.
8. If it is your first time follow the configuration steps, open a terminal/shell, and type this, git config --global user.name "Your name here", press enter then type this, git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
9. After doing the configuration, you can now practice, create a new file and name it index.html, create an html boilerplate, create an open h1 tag  and put this inside the h1 tag, my first git practice, then close h1 tag.
10. Then save your work. After saving your work, execute the following commands: type git status then press the enter key, type git add . then press the enter key on the keyboard, type this git commit -m "initial commit" then press enter key on the keyboard, then type git push origin main then press the enter key on the keyboard.
11. Finally if you have followed properly the steps, you are in good shape.
